It was considered amongst an unknown number of competitors, based on cost, types of available plans, customer support, investment funds, and education &amp; advice. No compensation was exchanged for this award. The author is a client of Betterment. For more information, visit https://www.bankrate.com/retirement/best-401k-plans/. </p><p> Based on actual advisory fees paid on taxable accounts only for Betterment individual retail client users in 2022. Tax savings calculations are based on clients’ self-reported income, tax filing status, and reported number of dependents, and they assume the standard deduction. Betterment’s calculations do not take into account the effects of any trades that may have occurred outside of Betterment in clients’ external accounts. This figure pertains to 2022 only, and does not consider any losses or gains from prior years. Note that harvest opportunities vary depending on market conditions in a given calendar year; 2022 may not be representative. Tax savings through TLH+ are not a measure of investment performance and results are not guaranteed. Please see Betterment’s TLH+ White Paper and TLH+ Disclosure for more information. Betterment is not a licensed tax advisor. Tax Loss Harvesting+ (TLH+) is not suitable for all investors, and certain conditions apply; consider your personal circumstances before deciding whether to utilize Betterment’s TLH+ feature. </p><p> Calculation as of 12/31/2023, and reflects the average individual rate of return for composites of funded retail taxable and IRA accounts in the Core portfolio strategy with a 90/10 stock-to-bond allocation. Users in the “auto-deposit on” groups earned an additional 6% annualized over 10 years, 1% annualized over 5 years, and 6% over the last year. The “auto-deposit on” groups include clients with auto-deposit turned on for at least 90% of the days in the relevant period. The “auto-deposit off” groups include clients with auto-deposit turned off for at least 90% of the days in the relevant period. Note that due to the eligibility criteria for Betterment’s advisory fee tiers, clients in the “auto-deposit off” groups are more likely to have been subject to Betterment’s $4 monthly fee in 2023, and this may have impacted their returns, along with other factors. </p><p> Betterment LLC was recognized as the Best Overall Robo Advisor for 2024 by Business Insider on February 29th, 2024.

This APY is variable and subject to change daily. Deposit balances are not allocated equally among the participating Program Banks. A minimum deposit of $10 is required, but there is no minimum balance required to be maintained. The APY available to a customer may be lower if that customer designates a bank or banks as ineligible to receive deposits. APY applies only to Cash Reserve and does not apply to checking accounts held through Betterment Checking. Cash Reserve and Betterment Checking are separate offerings and are not linked accounts. </p><p> See Betterment&#39;s Form ADV Part II and Terms and Conditions for additional information, including details on the deposit allocation methodology. </p><p> ** The national average savings account interest rate is reported by the FDIC (as of March 18, 2024) as the average annual percentage yield (APY) for savings accounts with deposits under $100,000. </p><p> † Betterment Cash Reserve (&quot;Cash Reserve&quot;) is offered by Betterment LLC. Clients of Betterment LLC participate in Cash Reserve through their brokerage account held at Betterment Securities. Neither Betterment LLC nor any of its affiliates is a bank. Through Cash Reserve, clients&#39; funds are deposited into one or more banks (&quot;Program Banks&quot;) where the funds earn a variable interest rate and are eligible for FDIC insurance. Cash Reserve provides Betterment clients with the opportunity to earn interest on cash intended to purchase securities through Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities. Cash Reserve should not be viewed as a long-term investment option. </p><p> Funds held in your brokerage accounts are not FDIC-insured but are protected by SIPC. Funds in transit to or from Program Banks are generally not FDIC-insured but are protected by SIPC, except when those funds are held in a sweep account following a deposit or prior to a withdrawal, at which time funds are eligible for FDIC insurance but are not protected by SIPC. See Betterment Client Agreements for further details. If you participate in Cash Reserve, you authorize Betterment, on a discretionary basis, to direct Betterment Securities as to the allocation of your funds among one or more Program Banks. Deposits at each Program Bank are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity (e.g. individual or joint). In aggregate, funds deposited into Cash Reserve are eligible for up to $2,000,000 (or $4,000,000 for joint accounts) of FDIC insurance once the funds reach one or more Program Banks (up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity—e.g., individual or joint—at up to eight Program Banks). Even if there are more than eight Program Banks, clients will not necessarily have deposits allocated in a manner that will provide FDIC insurance above $2,000,000 (or $4,000,000 for joint accounts). The FDIC calculates the insurance limits based on all accounts held in the same insurable capacity at a bank, not just cash in Cash Reserve. Although certain types of accounts, such as trust accounts may be eligible for additional FDIC insurance based on the number of beneficiaries, funds will be allocated to each Program Bank in such a way that provides up to $250,000 of FDIC insurance for individual accounts, $500,000 of FDIC insurance for joint accounts, and $250,000 of FDIC insurance for trust and other corporate account types, in each case per Program Bank. In the event you maintain an individual or joint Cash Reserve account and are a beneficiary of a Cash Reserve trust account, Betterment does not provide FDIC insurance based on your status as a beneficiary. If clients elect to exclude one or more Program Banks from receiving deposits the amount of FDIC insurance available through Cash Reserve may be lower. Clients are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each Program Bank, including existing deposits held at Program Banks outside of Cash Reserve, to ensure FDIC insurance limits are not exceeded, which could result in some funds being uninsured. For more information on FDIC insurance please visit www.FDIC.gov. Deposits held in Program Banks are not protected by SIPC.
