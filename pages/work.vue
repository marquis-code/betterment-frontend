        Based on actual advisory fees paid on taxable accounts only for
        Betterment individual retail client users in 2022. Tax savings
        calculations are based on clients’ self-reported income, tax filing
        status, and reported number of dependents, and they assume the standard
        deduction. Betterment’s calculations do not take into account the
        effects of any trades that may have occurred outside of Betterment in
        clients’ external accounts. This figure pertains to 2022 only, and does
        not consider any losses or gains from prior years. Note that harvest
        opportunities vary depending on market conditions in a given calendar
        year; 2022 may not be representative. Tax savings through TLH+ are not a
        measure of investment performance and results are not guaranteed. Please
        see Betterment’s TLH+ White Paper and TLH+ Disclosure for more
        information. Betterment is not a licensed tax advisor. Tax Loss

        Calculation as of 12/31/2023, and reflects the average individual rate
        of return for composites of funded retail taxable and IRA accounts in
        the Core portfolio strategy with a 90/10 stock-to-bond allocation. Users
        in the “auto-deposit on” groups earned an additional 6% annualized over
        10 years, 1% annualized over 5 years, and 6% over the last year. The
        “auto-deposit on” groups include clients with auto-deposit turned on for
        at least 90% of the days in the relevant period. The “auto-deposit off”
        groups include clients with auto-deposit turned off for at least 90% of
        the days in the relevant period. Note that due to the eligibility
        criteria for Betterment’s advisory fee tiers, clients in the
        “auto-deposit off” groups are more likely to have been subject to
        Betterment’s $4 monthly fee in 2023, and this may have impacted their
        returns, along with other factors.

        For Cash Reserve (“CR”), Betterment LLC only receives compensation from
        our program banks; Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities do not
        charge fees on your CR balance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The annual percentage yield ("APY") on the deposit balances in
        Betterment Cash Reserve ("Cash Reserve") is 5.00% and represents the
        weighted average of the APY on deposit balances at the banks
        participating in Cash Reserve (the "Program Banks") and is current as of
        April 2, 2024. This APY is variable and subject to change daily. Deposit
        balances are not allocated equally among the participating Program
        Banks. A minimum deposit of $10 is required, but there is no minimum
        balance required to be maintained. The APY available to a customer may
        be lower if that customer designates a bank or banks as ineligible to
        receive deposits. APY applies only to Cash Reserve and does not apply to
        checking accounts held through Betterment Checking. Cash Reserve and
        Betterment Checking are separate offerings and are not linked accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
        See Betterment's Form ADV Part II and Terms and Conditions for
        additional information, including details on the deposit allocation
        methodology.

      <p>
        ** The national average savings account interest rate is reported by the
        FDIC (as of March 18, 2024) as the average annual percentage yield (APY)
        for savings accounts with deposits under $100,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        † Betterment Cash Reserve ("Cash Reserve") is offered by Betterment LLC.
        Clients of Betterment LLC participate in Cash Reserve through their
        brokerage account held at Betterment Securities. Neither Betterment LLC
        nor any of its affiliates is a bank. Through Cash Reserve, clients'
        funds are deposited into one or more banks ("Program Banks") where the
        funds earn a variable interest rate and are eligible for FDIC insurance.
        Cash Reserve provides Betterment clients with the opportunity to earn
        interest on cash intended to purchase securities through Betterment LLC
        and Betterment Securities. Cash Reserve should not be viewed as a
        long-term investment option.
      </p>

      <p>
        Funds held in your brokerage accounts are not FDIC-insured but are
        protected by SIPC. Funds in transit to or from Program Banks are
        generally not FDIC-insured but are protected by SIPC, except when those
        funds are held in a sweep account following a deposit or prior to a
        withdrawal, at which time funds are eligible for FDIC insurance but are
        not protected by SIPC. See Betterment Client Agreements for further
        details. If you participate in Cash Reserve, you authorize Betterment,
        on a discretionary basis, to direct Betterment Securities as to the
        allocation of your funds among one or more Program Banks. Deposits at
        each Program Bank are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000 for each
        insurable capacity (e.g. individual or joint). In aggregate, funds
        deposited into Cash Reserve are eligible for up to $2,000,000 (or
        $4,000,000 for joint accounts) of FDIC insurance once the funds reach
        one or more Program Banks (up to $250,000 for each insurable
        capacity—e.g., individual or joint—at up to eight Program Banks). Even
        if there are more than eight Program Banks, clients will not necessarily
        have deposits allocated in a manner that will provide FDIC insurance
        above $2,000,000 (or $4,000,000 for joint accounts). The FDIC calculates
        the insurance limits based on all accounts held in the same insurable
        capacity at a bank, not just cash in Cash Reserve. Although certain
        types of accounts, such as trust accounts may be eligible for additional
        FDIC insurance based on the number of beneficiaries, funds will be
        allocated to each Program Bank in such a way that provides up to
        $250,000 of FDIC insurance for individual accounts, $500,000 of FDIC
        insurance for joint accounts, and $250,000 of FDIC insurance for trust
        and other corporate account types, in each case per Program Bank. In the
        event you maintain an individual or joint Cash Reserve account and are a
        beneficiary of a Cash Reserve trust account, Betterment does not provide
        FDIC insurance based on your status as a beneficiary. If clients elect
        to exclude one or more Program Banks from receiving deposits the amount
        of FDIC insurance available through Cash Reserve may be lower. Clients
        are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each Program Bank,
        including existing deposits held at Program Banks outside of Cash
        Reserve, to ensure FDIC insurance limits are not exceeded, which could
        result in some funds being uninsured. For more information on FDIC
        insurance please visit www.FDIC.gov. Deposits held in Program Banks are
        not protected by SIPC. For more information see the full terms and
        conditions and Betterment LLC's Form ADV Part 2.

      <h3>Let’s Talk About Risk:</h3>
      <p>
        Investing involves risk and there is the potential of losing money when
        you invest in securities and digital assets. Past performance does not
        guarantee future results and the likelihood of investment outcomes are
        hypothetical in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Investments in securities and digital assets are: Not FDIC Insured • Not
        Bank Guaranteed • May Lose Value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, investing in digital assets is highly speculative and
        volatile, and only suitable for investors who are able to bear the risk
        of potential loss and experience sharp drawdowns. Digital assets are not
        legal tender and are not backed by the U.S. government. Digital assets
        are not subject to SIPC protections.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before investing, consider your investment objectives and Betterment
        LLC's fees and expenses. Betterment LLC's internet-based advisory
        services are designed to assist clients in achieving discrete financial
        goals. They are not intended to provide comprehensive tax advice or

        situation and do not incorporate specific investments that clients hold
        elsewhere. For more details, see Betterment’s Form CRS, Form ADV Part II
        and other disclosures.
